# Codoseek - iNTUition 2018

Codoseek came out as an idea during iNTUition Hackathon 2018. 
While the product is far from what we have envisioned to be, this is not bad for a few hours' hack. 

## Requirements

Run the npm commands for both Express and Vue frameworks.  
Most importantly, the access token is needed to make API calls which you would need to grab one for yourself.  
(Otherwise, PM-ing will do as well. I can share my token ;))
